# Context
- In the real world, you may have multiple decisions to make. You know how much they would make you feel, 10 being ecstatic but 1 being "I wish I never did it".
- It isn't limited to quality (happiness) but also quantity. (Utility = 10 cars Cost = 50,000)
- The script simulates the model of what economists call Utility Maximization (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/utility-maximization/).
- The script goes like this: (Name) Want - (Item)enjoyment/need/Quantity - (Cost)cost/time
- In the script already, imagine you have 3 choices of rollercoaster. 
- First ride gives you 10/10 happiness but will cost 80 minutes of line waiting. etc etc
- The program will output the third option, 6/10 satisfaction and 40 minute wait.
- Through the calculations, it will assume maximum satisfaction. (Time + enjoyment)
- But, as said, (Utility = 10 cars Cost = 50,000) etc you can work out the maximum output in a business need
